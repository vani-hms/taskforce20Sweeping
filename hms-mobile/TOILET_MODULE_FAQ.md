## 🏗️ Asset Registration

### 3. How do I register a new Asset?
Navigate to the **Cleanliness Module** → **Register** tab and fill in the required details:

### 4. Why can't I see my Ward in the list?
Wards are assigned by the City Admin. If your ward is missing, contact your administrator to ensure your profile is correctly mapped to the required zones and wards.

### 5. My registration is "PENDING". When will it be approved?
New asset requests must be approved by the **City Admin** on the web portal. Once approved, the status will change to **APPROVED** in your "My Requests" tab, and the asset will be available for assignment.

## 🧼 Inspections & Audits

### 6. Where do I find assets assigned to me?
Go to the **"Tasks"** tab in the Cleanliness Module. You will see a list of assets with status indicators:
*   🟢 **Green:** Recently inspected.
*   🟡 **Yellow:** Due soon.
*   🔴 **Overdue:** Needs immediate inspection.

### 7. Why does the app say I am "Outside Area"?
To prevent fraud, you must be within **100 meters** of the asset's registered location to start an inspection. 
*   Ensure you are standing at the site.
*   If the asset's registered location is incorrect, report it to your administrator.

### 8. How many photos should I take?
For each question in the checklist, you can take up to **3 photos**. 
*   **Requirement:** At least **1 photo proof** is usually required per question to ensure the QC officer can verify the condition.
*   **Quality:** Photos are automatically optimized to save data and memory.

### 9. Can I change my answers after submitting?
No. Once an inspection is submitted, it goes to the QC team for review. If you made a mistake, you must wait for the QC to **REJECT** it with remarks, allowing you to re-inspect.

## ⚙️ Technical Troubleshooting

### 10. GPS Accuracy Issues
If the app fails to fetch your location:
1.  Ensure **Location Services (GPS)** is turned ON in your phone settings.
2.  Ensure you have given **"Always"** or **"While Using the App"** permission to HMS.
3.  Move to an open area away from tall buildings for better satellite reception.

### 11. Camera Stability
If the camera crashes or feels slow:
*   Wait for the camera to initialize (the app has a built-in 500ms safety delay).
*   Avoid taking photos too rapidly.
*   Ensure your phone has sufficient storage space.

### 12. Session Expired / Auto Logout
For security, login tokens expire after **20 minutes** of inactivity. If you are logged out, simply log back in to continue. Your in-progress inspection might be lost if not submitted before the session ends.
